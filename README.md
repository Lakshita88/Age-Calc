Using your birth date and other information to construct a  age calculator that 
shows the number of days till your next birthday. This project was created using JavaScript.

Some built-in date and time methods are available in JavaScript, which are generally used to determine the age from a date. 
These JavaScript techniques make it simple to determine someone's age.
We usually  need the user to input a date and the current system date in order to do this. 

In the javascript code-
In order to store the value of the array of month days under the month variable, we must first create the array.
Using the getELEMENTById selector, choose the HTML elements, and then save their values in the new variables.

The new Date () function allowed us to obtain the device's time and date. To retrieve the latest current dates from your device, 
utilise the JavaScript method "New Date." These three variables,
which effectively denote the current time, are determined by the current year, current day, and current month.

Thank you.
